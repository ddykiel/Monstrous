#Dream wrath

#Dream hunger
dream_hunger = "You see Briar’s face rise in your consciousness: wide deep-brown eyes, pensive lips, face framed with blue hair. You don’t dream of her often. Your dreams are quiet, awe-struck, often clouded with shame or melancholy happiness. Briar feels too concrete and sacred for them." + \
               '\n' + "You can’t remember the dream you had with her. But you remember one she had once, that she told you about: where she killed you, and you killed her, and you took each other’s place in society." + \

#Dream coldness
dream_coldness = "It’s been a long time since you’ve thought about Ino. Though, perhaps they’re always with you. How you hurt each other—or, rather, how you hurt them. The little cruelties, living hopes that withered." \
                 "\nYou were in a building, amorpheous and unfamiliar. The hallways, with their narrow and dark-wooded walls, didn’t exist in real life, but you knew they were your childhood home. You turned over your shoulder. Ino stared at you. Wide-eyed, head angled, wearing an expression both accusing and vapid. You wake with the taste of metal in your mouth." \
                 "\nSomething about the dream reminds you of another one—your body splayed on a bed with dark red sheets, neck snapped. It was a dream about death, crawling beneath your skin, but it had a dull, deep edge of resignation."

#Middle

middle1 = "The sunlight in your dorm is cold, antiseptic. It filters over your bare walls and blue striped sheets, trickles down from the popcorn ceilings. Your desk is spacious and wide, save for  a lamp, a few sticky notes, and a printer. You keep the floors swept clean. In the center of the room is a large, empty space, right in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows." \
          + '\n' + "The room is impersonal but comfortable. You haven’t sunk into it, disturbed it, forced it to adapt. Soon, you’ll hang up pictures, buy some rugs and chairs, gather knicknacks on your desk. But not yet." \
          + '\n' + "College has wrung your foundation out from under you. No one here knows your familier patterns of speech, the roles you fell into when in groups. You want to build yourself up. Differently, better. And then you’ll know how to fill this space." \

You tap your finger against your dull blue desk, and the sound echoes, dull and muffled." + '\n' + "Outside, the Fall air is fresh and bright, comfortably cool. There are things waiting for you there: friends to chat with, crushes to flirt with, new locations on campus to explore. But right now you can’t move. You can't collect yourself. You have one more recollection to attend to."

ctext1 = "Beneath your skin, old memories hum and burn. Though you try not to, sometimes they become tainted, slip from your tongue and gather dirt from outside.

When you place your hand over your cheek, you feel them pulse."
cchoice1 = "What do you try to do?" + '\n' + "Internalize them (1) | Ignore them (2)"

ctext2 = "Most of these memories you gained a while ago. You slipped into politeness with the beat and rhythm of your favorite song. Maybe it’s from your parents, their European roots: “American children are so rude, but we raised you better.” Another brick to your immature, crumbling sense of superiority."\
         + '\n' + "You cared about people, you really did—but sometimes you smiled and nodded with an encouragement that wasn’t entirely sincere. You hadn’t internalized cruelty yet, the ability to hand back their aches and pains and say they weren’t yours to carry." \

cchoice2 = "How do you feel when people tell you their secrets?" + '\n' + "Honored (1) | Annoyed (2)"

ctext3 = "Your memories of Ino—and Ino’s secrets—have become chalky with time. There’s no more pain that can be felt from them. Yet, it’s hard to reflect without any guilt." \

cchoice3 = "Should you have known better?" + '\n' + "Yes (1) | No (2)"

ctext4 = "You knew them in elementary school, middle school, the first year of high school. Yet somehow, the moments all feel the same. They all have the same dull, removed tint as your middle school hallways. Gray light filtering through, as if each photon were coated in dust." \
         + '\n' + "When Ino moved away, you were thankful you wouldn’t have to see them in the hallways, their face ducking away from you." \
         + '\n' + "You remember an argument you had, when you tried to catch up to them and apologize. They dodged between the buses as if they were being hunted. You didn’t know you were capable of having such power over another person."
cchoice4 = "Did you enjoy it?" + '\n' + "Yes (1) | No (2)"

ctext5 = "You let your closeness grow until it encroached on your skin, until tearing it away became visceral.You had no other friends; or at least, none who came close to your level of intimacy. If you used the term “friend” for Ino, you couldn’t use it for anyone else." \
         + '\n' + "When you and Ino spoke, your voices climbed and twisted around each other. You laughed exuberantly, losing all self-consciousness, all awareness. You begin to speak faster and faster, in a sickening spiral." \
         + '\n' + "After you had broken ties from Ino in middle school, you were assigned the same lab group in freshman year. Any relationship you grew would have to get cut off again—there were only so many times you were willing to make the same mistake. Still, it was too easy to loose yourself. Music, jokes, exams, college—it didn’t matter what you talked about. You just clicked. Your friendship resumed at a breakneck pace, even as you tried to keep your distance, to extradite yourself."
cchoice5 = "Did you really try?" + '\n' + "Yes (1) | No (2)"

ctext6 = "They commanded your attention. Even when you had your head craned away, even when you were trying to read instructions on the board. It was more than the loudness of their voice, their sudden, overly-aestheticized movements. The jaunty tilt of a chin resting on a hand, as if hoping to be noticed, to be found endearing." \
         + '\n' + "“I hate getting up for morning classes,” they said, their tone strained. “Just push me into oncoming traffic.” You didn’t reply. “No, really.” You turn to look at them. They held your gaze, insistent. “I’m serious. Push me. I want to fucking die.”" \
         + '\n' + "You could have reported them to the counselor, but they had been reported multiple times. You had reported them once, in middle school, when you stopped being friends, and you were afraid of them walking through the halls alone. Their parents didn’t believe in therapists, depression, mental health. Nothing had been done—nothing would be done."

ctext7 = "Another memory returns to you: their small and cramped apartment. Their cat had bumpy fleas when you scratched under its chin." \
         + '\n' + "“She’s the one who gave me these scratches,” Ino said, gesturing to cuts on their arms. Their skin puckered around the cuts, long and thin and vertical, already scabbing over. There was a trembling edge to Ino’s voice—but perhaps you imagined it, had read too many books with hopeless narrators."
cchoice7 = "Did you think they were self-inflicted?" + '\n' + "Yes (1) | No (2)"

ctext8 = "The closeness between you and Ino was breathing, vibrant, if unhealthy—but it wasn’t your entire world." \
         + '\n' + "At recess, they told the teacher that you were wearing the wrong kind of shoes, so you would have to stay inside with them. When you began to befriend a new girl, Briar, in your eight-grade English class, Ino disagreed with everything you and Briar said. They were snippy and haughty enough that you and Briar remember the strangeness of that situation years later, even if you don’t remember what was said." \

ctext9 = "There were other reasons you began to feel suffocated. They would insult you with undercutting jokes, no matter how often you asked them not to. They would talk at you even though your expression had long since glazed over. Most likely, you had done things against them, too—but this you remember even less." \
         + '\n' + "You went to your mother for advice. You should have realized she had never liked Ino, found your closeness at the expense of others distasteful. You should have realized that she had no authority on relationships; maybe you even should have begun to realize how she would butcher yours." \
         + '\n' + "“Tell Ino you don’t want to be friends anymore,” your mother said. “Make it quick. Make it clean.”" \
         + '\n' + "You made a list of pros and cons. You couldn’t stand the feeling of your skin, Ino’s presence encroached and scabbed over. You decided to end your friendship."
cchoice9 = "Was the decision mostly yours or your mother's?" + '\n' + "Yours (1) | Your mother's (2)"

ctext10 = "You confronted Ino—you don’t remember how. Afterwards, you felt that you should have been softer. You felt that you should have let them down gently, and not torn away a pillar in their already unstable life." \
          + '\n' + "That was the day you tried to apologize in English class, and you saw them run away from you."
cchoice10 = click

ctext11 = "Years later—in high school—you apologized to them. You can’t remember their expression, their tone of voice. Only a removed sense of relief."
cchoice11 = "Why did you apologize?" + '\n' + "To absolve yourself of guilt (1) | It was the right thing to do (2)"

ctext12 = "In high school, there were two or three people you saw Ino walking with in the hallway, or sitting with at lunch. You had no way of knowing the nature of those friendships, but you were happy they existed." \
          + '\n' + "Ino told you that their parents wanted them to live at home while in college. Ino was terrified of never being free of them." \
          + '\n' + "You don’t want something to happen to them—you want them to be okay. But a cold, cynical part of you wouldn’t be surprised. If you opened Facebook, years later, to hear about struggles with mental health, maybe even a hospitalization."
cchoice12 = "If something happened, would you feel responsible?" + '\n' + "Yes (1) | No (2)"

ctext13 = "You wish Ino hadn’t been part of a pattern. But it had been the same—Sam, earlier in elementary school, you two the center of your rocky, oscillating friend group. Jayden, partly overlapping Ino, where you listened to his band obsessions and created dragon worlds together. You cut him off almost as abruptly, too. And, finally, Briar. You both started with vestiges of codependency, unhealthiness—but slowly, painstakingly, you learned to grow. With and for each other, but mostly for yourselves." \
          + '\n' + "Ino moved away, and you stopped thinking of them as much. Still, every now and then, they cross your mind. You hope that they’ve found freedom, meaningful friendships—even if that hadn’t been you."
cchoice13 = click

cendingquote = "I need to remember how to write stories for myself. Lose the performative, the fog, bury the face in the glass. Even mirrors, with their living and breathing images, stare back with wide-eyed innocence. Too many times have I thought of myself rising like smoke. To see if my body is really my own, if a hint of truth glimmers through, or if I’m nothing more than artificial."

######################### HUNGER TEXT #########################

hbeginningquote = "I laugh at people who say vulnerability is strength. Vulnerabilities exist, must be acknowledged, like cats yowling for food, but God: I rue the day all I’m known for is being hungry." \

htext1 = "Your town courts their obsession. It permeates like blood beneath veins, bones beneath skin. You would go so far as to call it a sickness. What else would contort the minds and bodies of teenagers—children, even—to bruise their eyes from lack of sleep, break down crying in the bathroom over test scores?" \
         + '\n' + "Parents move to the town for the successful high school, deplete their bank accounts with ridiculous property taxes. They talk about College-capital C college-in hushed voices. “Go to a school that fits,” teachers say. “Prestige doesn’t matter.” But the words lack conviction. Nobody believes them."

How else will they ever find fulfillment?"

htext3 = "It feels like survival. Scurrying through narrow hallways with tepid flourescent lights, dodging comments from teachers: “You kids are smart, this school is good, you’re not like those other kids, those other schools.”" \
         + '\n' + "Your town is plagued with suicides. Four in two years, one of them an elementary schooler. Even more alumni. A famous newspaper writes an article about it. Of course, the reasons are murky. Any fingers pointing blame bend and shiver under their lack of certainty." \
         + '\n' + "Still, what a call to fame."
hchoice3 = click

htext4 = "The school felt torn in two directions" \
         + '\n' + "The first: People crying and hugging in hallways. Classrooms set aside for mass mourning. Petitions sent to the administration for their cold-heartedness." \
         + '\n' + "The second: Teachers giving homework as usual. Flourescent lights humming, deadlines looming. An announcement about the suicide during period three, lost in the shuffle of students in hallways." \
         + '\n' + "Beneath it all—a cloying, sickening concern. Hushed discussions on mental health, goody bags of cheerful paraphernelia. Censorship of student writing deemed too depressing. The school hired no new counselors or psychologists, made no structural changes." \
         + '\n' + "When the suicides happened, you didn’t feel much. You didn’t know them. The day after, you felt young and stupid, reminding yourself not to laugh too loud with your friend."
hchoice4 = "Should you have cared more?" + '\n' + "Yes (1) | No (2)"

htext5 = "When you talk about your high school to other people, their eyes narrow, trying to envision it. Your school becomes scrubbed clean in bright, pure sunlight, melts like ice in warm candlelight. The whole town, in fact, rises from your lips in a mirage, and then dissipates. On the phone with Briar, you discuss the inevitable question of nostalgia." \
         + '\n' + "“I don’t miss the town,” you say. “I miss the people.”" \
         + '\n' + "As soon as you say it, you wonder if it’s true. You struggled against your town: you took the train to the City, wandered aimlessly through the woods, to avoid the suburban roads and strip malls."

hchoice5 = "Maybe it has a tighter hold on you than you’d like to think." + '\n' + "It does (1) | It doesn't (2)"

htext6 = "You and Briar have other friends, of course: but “people” mostly refers to each other. You were close enough that most of the school thought you were a couple. When you mentioned your boyfriend to one of your classmates, her mouth opened in surprise." \

hchoice6 = "Did you care that people misunderstood your relationship?" + '\n' + "Yes (1) | No (2)"

htext7 = "In the first years of knowing each other, you read books about taut, unhealthy friendships, identified with both main characters at once. You spent your lunches together, joined the same clubs, and hung out on weekends. A few times, people referred to you by the others’ name, even though you looked nothing alike." \
           + '\n' + "You leaned heavily on each other, but with a sincere earnestness. There was no passive-aggressiveness, no undercutting comments."
hchoice7 = "Still, did your closeness feel like a threat to your identity?" + '\n' + "Yes (1) | No (2)"

htext8 = "In sophomore year, you both submitted to the same poetry competition. You loved the elegance of her words, their concrete and mechanical nature. She was chosen to read to the school auditorium. Everything about her was scultped stone, regal and immortal. Fitted red jacket, wide searching eyes, words heavy and emphatic. She moved the way a soft, detailed marble statue looks like it could. You were proud, honored to be her friend."
hchoice8 = "But maybe, just maybe, you felt a little jealousy too." + '\n' + "You did (1) | You didn't (2)"

htext9 = "Even while you and Briar orbited around each other, your paths began to widen. Your clubs list becames differentiated; you joined other circles of friends.

harbtext = "The arboretum was where you and Briar had one of your talks. You had many talks, but some became ornate and twisted in your memory, wrought-iron. You started in the cool, shadowy woods, and ended at a flowered, emerald field sunk behind a hill, steeping in the summer heat." \

######################### MONSTER DESCRIPTIONS #########################

hand_desc = "You consider yourself more important than your relationships. You take full responsibility for your negative traits. Additionally, you value ambition and self-actualization. Your monstrous side is a source of strength and empowerment. Your downfall rests in your sense of self-importance and insular perspective, which can isolate you from the emotions and viewpoints of others. By accepting yourself completely, you risk being more cruel than you need to be."
teeth_desc = "You linger on your trauma, and it remains steeped in regret. You believe yourself responsible for your own monstrosity, and have no control over it. Intentionally or not, you limit your closeness to other people as you believe you will hurt them. Your strength resides in honest, careful self-reflection. You embrace most crushing responsibility possible. If you grow past it, or accept it as empowerment, nothing will be able to break you."
eye_desc = "You’re human: or at least, you think you are. You value relationships deeply and focus on others more than yourself. This can lead to a lack of honesty and self-reflection, as you blame others for your flaws. However, you generally believe in people’s good intentions. Even if they cause you pain, you see it accidental and shrug it off. You could keep living happily like this. Though, if you want to strengthen the relationships you value so deeply, you may need to turn your focus inwards and let yourself experience negativity."
throat_desc = "Your trauma has made you defensive. Your throat is bared to the outside world, but you do everything you can to harden it and protect yourself. You desire validation from others, but rarely find it. Often, they hurt you, or you’re too closed-off to form a genuine connection. You think others are the cause of your monstrous traits, but you direct your frustrations at yourself. Your strength comes from recognizing that things may not be your fault, but they are your responsibility. No matter what happens in your life, you will be able to examine and integrate it. The challenge lies in doing this productively, without limiting yourself."
