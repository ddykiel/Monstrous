# Monstrous
A text-based video game about the malleability of memory and facing your worst traits

About the game:

You can’t choose your past, but you choose how to remember it. In Monstrous, you face memories of your worst traits. How you reflect on them will determine who you become in the next chapter of your life. Your past has made you into a monster—but what kind of monster will it be?

Gameplay:

The game gives the user a selection of text and asks them to make a choice by clicking on a button.
At the end of the game, the user is given a monster, based on how they chose to experience their memories. The monster represents the personification of the user’s negative traits. Each monster will be accompanied with an art piece.
There are four monsters available, each corresponding with a different body part.

The game will have three main branches, or reflections. The user will play all of the branches. However, the user chooses the order of the branches.
